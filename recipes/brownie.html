    <h2>Homemade Brownie Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>116g butter</li>
        <li>166g semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>350g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 whole eggs</li>
        <li>230g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> a pinch of salt</li>
       </ul> 

    <h2>Step by Step to The Perfect Brownie </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 170Â°C.</li>
            <li>Lightly spread a little bit of cooking oil line an baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar.</li>
            <li>In a medium high heat, melt the butter and chocolate chips together, than let ir cool just for a minute.</li>
            <li>First mix the wet ingredients and than add the flour and salt, together until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the top. 
                Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only 
                a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early 
                than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.</li>
